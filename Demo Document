Open-source are the software tools that are freely available without a commercial license across the web. Open Source denotes products which contains permission to use its source code, design documents or contents.
Open-source tools are commercially licensed and available to users for free. Popular examples of open-source tools include many of the software products from the Apache Foundation, such as big-data tool Hadoop, GIT, Eclipse, Node etc. These are freely available, with the licensing held by a user community, instead of a company making a profit from software. Anyone can use freely, share, and change open source software in modified or unmodified form. 

Values of Open Source
One of the greatest advantages of open source is it can used from anyone and can be implemented to anywhere since the source is easily available. The business value of open source software (OSS) goes beyond a company’s bottom line. The concept of freeware was introducing in 90’s when the internet popularity is at the peak. It encourages the open collaborations. Also, Open-sourcing is the act of propagating the open source movement widely and effectively. 

Below are the Few Open Source Tools Listed 

Testing Open-source Tools
Test management tools are very important to any test team. Test teams use these tools to help capture requirements, design test cases, map test cases to requirements, test execution reports and much more.

1.	Selenium WebDriver: - It was originally developed by Jason Huggins in 2004, Selenium gets its name from Greek Word ‘Selene’, which means Moon. The Selenium WebDriver is the most popular testing tool which caters different testing needs. It has an object-oriented API for testing modern complex web applications. It is quite like UFT, only that Selenium focuses on automating web-based applications. This was developed by Selenium to support dynamic web pages. 

Pros of Selenium WebDriver

•	Capable of testing across web browsers like Firefox, Chrome, IE etc.
•	Independence of using C#, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, JS(Node) and Ruby as scripting languages.
•	Tests for user-like actions on the web application.
•	Parallel execution on multiple machines is possible which saves time and effort.
•	Can be used for more complex testing such as production monitoring and load testing and API is also possible by creating the JSON file.

Cons of Selenium WebDriver

•	One of the major cons of Selenium is, it supports web browsers testing only.
•	Test maintenance is difficult, say due to the element waits in applications using AJAX.
•	Users need to learn and use different frameworks to standardize the testing process.
•	Proper implementation methods, if not followed, will slow down the testing.
•	No official technical support from any organizations or individuals.
